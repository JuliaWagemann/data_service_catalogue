The hydrological modelling was done for SWICCA with an ensemble of bias-corrected climate model data provided by the EU FP7 project IMPACT2C (grant agreement 282746). More information on the climate-model ensemble used (for instance model selection procedures, uncertainties, adjustments) can be found here: http://impact2c.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/csc/projekte/impact2c_d5.1_fin.pdf<br>Within the project IMPACT2C, the original RCM output data has been spatially interpolated, adjusted to the standard Gregorian calendar and has partly been bias-corrected. More details can be found here: http://impact2c.hzg.de/imperia/md/content/csc/projekte/impact2c_d4.1.pdf <br>The dataset covers the ensemble members given in Table 1. The ensemble comprises three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) to cover a range of policy scenarios: a mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), a stabilization scenario (RCP4.5) and a high greenhouse gas scenario (RCP8.5). The SWICCA indicators on catchment resolution are provided for an ensemble using one hydrological model (E-HYPEv3.1.2). The full ensemble of time series from the model runs is stored at SMHI and the original daily time-series of some essential climate variables can be downloaded from the SWICCA interface. |  * Reference period: 1971-01-01 to 2000-12-31 <br> * Future periods: 2011-01-01 to 2040-12-31 <br> * 2041-01-01 to 2070-12-31 <br> * 2071-01-01 to 2100-12-31| Catchment in Europe | Y.

Asessing thermal stress is important for worker health and safety, industrial productivity, and athletic performance. This heat stress index incorporates relevant meteorological variables related to physiological thermal stress into a single value. Many thermal stress indices have been developed since the early 1900s (see review and comparison by Epstein and Moran 2006). For example, the wet bulb globe temperature index (WBGT) developed by the U.S. Navy in 1957 has been used widely and adopted as an ISO standard (ISO 7243). The Thom index is selected for this work because it is highly correlated with the WBGT index and has the advantage of being technically easier to implemented. <br> Epstein Y, DS Moran 2006: Thermal comfort and the heat stress indices.
